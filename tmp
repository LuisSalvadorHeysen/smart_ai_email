Hi Aaron! I hope you are doing well. I'm Luis Heysen, a rising junior at UChicago from Peru, currently interning at Voya IM as a quant analyst and also at Scale AI. We met at the Meet Millennium Engineering event in early May, where you gave us a talk on how technology is used at Millennium. I was particularly captivated by your AI Email Client that you vibe coded, and I ended up making my own version (also vibe coded) that I’ve been using for my personal emails, it really does save a lot of time!

After the event, I felt that I align very well with the culture and values at Millennium, and I really liked everyone I met. I’m very interested in interning at Millennium next summer, especially in a Software Engineering position, and I was wondering if you had any tips on how to maximize my chances of getting an offer. Your career path is truly inspiring, and I’d love to hear more about your journey and any advice you might have.

By the way, I noticed you’re from Spain! As a fun fact, I’ll be traveling to Toledo this Fall for Thanksgiving.

If you have a few minutes sometime, I’d really appreciate the chance to chat and learn from your experience, whenever is convenient for you. Thanks so much, and hope to connect soon!
